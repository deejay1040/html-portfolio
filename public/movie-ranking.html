<h1>The Best Movies According to DeeJay</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>James Cameron's 1997 masterpiece, “Titanic” is one of the best movies of all times.  The story ends up in tragedy and even with heart-wrenching scenes of the disaster of the maiden voyage of “Titanic” in 1912, the stunning recreations of the ship’s interior and its sinking are astonishing.</p>
<p>The love story of Rose, through her recollections as a survivor, and the song "My Heart Will Go On" are the most unforgettable for me. </p>

<h3>Mufasa</h3>
<p>What I liked most about “Mufasa” was its themes and messages. It has touched upon the themes such as, identity, responsibility, and the sacrifices that come with leadership. Throughout the journey of Mufasa as a cub who has lost his family until he became the Lion King, it emphasizes the idea that a true leader’s strength lies not in physical prowess, but in the ability to inspire and uplift others.  </p>
<p>Apart from the  strong message, the movie’s stunning visuals, well developed characters and compelling plot  as a whole made it a beautiful movie for fans of any age to enjoy together.</p>

<h3>The Sound of Music</h3>
<p>“Sound of Music” is another favourite of mine. It's a timelss classic. Its enchanting music, stunning scenery, and heartfelt story are sure to captivate anyone's heart and leave a lasting impression.</p>
<p>Julie Andrews, an iconic figure in the world of cinema, is starring in this movie. Her portrayal of “Maria” is particularly memorable, showcasing her talents as an actress and singer; a very rare combination for a person to have.</p>
